We had a tent site that backed up to the creek and it had trees and shade and turned out to be so relaxing and wonderful and quiet.  We met up with our family there and they loved the site.  Evan is wonderful - he will do all that he can to make your stay as best as he can.  The bathrooms (showers) a kept fastidiously clean.  The campground is clean of trash.

A lot of live in's , area needs to be mowed badly (we got lots of burrs in our rugs) and had to fight the woman the next day for a bathroom key. We were locked out of bathhouse the first night and then I had to track down lady on golf cart for key. She griped about not giving out too many keys because the health department is not happy with too many people using restrooms. She complained about having to clean up after people use them. She said campers should be self contained, whine, whine, whine... She tried to say website told us this (does not or I wouldn't have booked there). Next day, same crabby woman asked if we had more than one A/C unit because her electricity can't handle the load. I only have one A/C and I didn't see any with 2 units but our electricity had been out and clocks needed resetting. Crazy place for sure. Once I got key to bathhouse, I expected some kind of golden throne but nothing fancy. Clean enough but nothing to brag about. Did laundry. Only 2 washers but they worked and dryers were good. the place is in need of attention and someone who cares more. It's a shame, could be really nice.\",\n",

Well, we couldn't find another place to stay and I reconsidered. I'm glad I did.  The camp ground manager, Evan, was fantastic.  He gave us the best service ever.  We had a tent site that backed up to the creek and it had trees and shade and turned out to be so relaxing and wonderful and quiet.  We met up with our family there and they loved the site.  Evan is wonderful - he will do all that he can to make your stay as best as he can.  The bathrooms (showers) a kept fastidiously clean.  The campground is clean of trash.

We were locked out of bathhouse the first night and then I had to track down lady on golf cart for key. She griped about not giving out too many keys because the health department is not happy with too many people using restrooms. She complained about having to clean up after people use them. She said campers should be self contained, whine, whine, whine... She tried to say website told us this (does not or I wouldn't have booked there). Next day, same crabby woman asked if we had more than one A/C unit because her electricity can't handle the load. I only have one A/C and I didn't see any with 2 units but our electricity had been out and clocks needed resetting. Crazy place for sure. Once I got key to bathhouse, I expected some kind of golden throne but nothing fancy. Clean enough but nothing to brag about. Did laundry. Only 2 washers but they worked and dryers were good. the place is in need of attention and someone who cares more. It's a shame, could be really nice.\", 1)\n",
